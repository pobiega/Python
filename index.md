# Pobiega's guide to getting started with Python

## Getting Python
First things first: we have to download and install python. Head on over to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version for your OS. At the time of writing, this is version 3.6.1. If you have a 64-bit OS (you most likely do in this day and age), you might as well snag the 64-bit version of Python.

Install it and proceed.

*Note: Version 2.7 is still widely used but is not recommended for learning Python or writing new scripts and programs. You can have both 2.7 and 3.6+ installed at the same time, but for this guide I recommend you just skip 2.7.*

## Picking an editor
Now this is where you have to make a choice. Python is an interpreted language, meaning that the programs are run directly from their sourcefiles. Python really shines at writing small programs with a very specific use in mind, commonly called __scripts__. These are often short and written in a single file, meaning that you don't need an overly complicated [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) to get the job done, all you need is a text editor. You can in fact write Python using nothing but Notepad, but I highly recommend getting a proper editor that has language support.

Below is a short list of some of the editors I have used and like.

### Visual Studio Code
Link: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
Available for: Windows, OS, Linux

VS Code is a fantastic editor that has a lot of really clever features while still being lightweight. Any directory can be opened as a project giving you a nice overview of your entire codebase. 

Features:
* Syntax-highlighting
* Built in git-support
* Debugging
* Smart completion / autocomplete
* Fantastic plugin system
* Quick-command to run active python file
* Integrated terminal

### Notepad++
Link: [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
Available for: Windows

Basicly a better notepad, giving it some much needed features. It's incredibly lightweight and fantastic if you just want something slightly more advanced than regular notepad.

Features:
* Syntax-highlighting
* Plugin system
* Quick-command to run active python file (configurable)

### PyCharm
Link: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
Available for: Windows, Mac, Linux

I did say that you don't need an IDE for writing smaller scripts. But if you want to write something bigger, you might want to consider PyCharm. It's a full-featured IDE with everything that entails. Downsides is that its a big piece of software and can take a while to load, plus a steeper learning curve. Perhaps not great for absolute beginners, it's maybe something you would consider using when you are a little bit more comfortable.

Features:
* Syntax-highlighting
* Built in git-support
* Debugging
* Smart completion / autocomplete
* Plugin system
* Quick-command to run active python project/file (super configurable)
* Integrated terminal
* Full-blown IDE
* Multiple Python installation-support (2.7 and 3.6, for example)
